# Menubar Icon

For the menubar icon, you'll need a 16x16 or 22x22 pixel PNG file. 

For now, the app will use the default Electron icon. To add a custom icon:

1. Create a 16x16 or 22x22 pixel PNG image
2. Save it as `iconTemplate.png` in this directory
3. For best results on macOS, use a black and white template image

The icon should be a simple, recognizable symbol that works well at small sizes.
